### Welcome to my Github ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a Web Developer, Occassional Blogger and Technology Enthusiast

I spend most of my time doing a range of personal web development projects around the web alongside my work for Accrosoft, where I work as a developer and deliver a range of web-based projects for our customers around the globe.

Before I started at Accrosoft, I worked for myself on various freelance web development projects and on my own technology news & reviews site that was called TechNutty (still not a fan of the name). I also spent a few years at the University of Derby, mostly drinking and playing Xbox, occasionally I studied Business Management and somehow managed to achieve a 2:1, which is fair enough. ðŸ˜‚

I aim to use this github to share the occassional weird thing that I'm working on.
